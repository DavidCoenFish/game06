Code2002, a Plane 2 Unicode-based Font 
</H2>

</CENTER><BR><BR>

Code2002 is a Plane 2 Unicode-based font (TTF).

<BR><BR>

The font is correctly encoded for Plane 2 per the latest TTF/OTF
specifications.  (As of twenty years ago.)  Both Apple and Microsoft
now include specifications for cmap format 12 at their respective
typography web sites.

<BR><BR>

In this version, the coverage is still incomplete and many of the glyphs
are rough.  Just like all the previous versions.  Maybe it keeps getting a
little better each time, though.

<br><br>

Version 0.922 adds a few more glyphs covering a few more characters and
adds complete support for the new CJK Extension I.

<br><br>
