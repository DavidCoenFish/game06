strech goal, make it loop

establish shot dusk, fog, mountains poking through fog, something serpentine and massive moving through fog
zoom in on cliff edge, a small golem with the body of a hexagon cobbelstone, with tiny arms/ legs/ head on faces of the hexagon
gollem reacts angerly to approaching archer, trying to warn them away/ make them stop
archer summons magic glowing green arrow to dispach golem, the hit gollem collapses then rolls to the edge of the cliff and slots into the edge of the cliff, extending the walking surface
two new golems jump up onto the cliff past the fallen golem
archer shoots both, they both roll to the edge of the cliff, and now 4 gollems jump up
as the sequence continues, 
    introduge rummbling/ ground shaking by around 8 -> 16 wave?
    missed gollems going past archer, combining offscreen into bigger column golums
    end up having jumping platforms of the the fallen golem as archer not being able to keep up shooting them all
    column golem combine into ground shaking giant golem
    archer being able to charge shot a bigger, deals with bigger combined golems, but only delays giant golum
    archer eventually falls to onslaught
//end, most but the fist golum drop down from being the bridge into the fog, first golumn returns to cliff edge
//archer is converted into a new golumn on cliff edge, throws shrunk down bow with green magic effect at first golumn, pushing off cliff
archer shapeshifted into a new golumn at cliff edge, throws bow with green magic effect at the other golumns falling away from the  bridge back down into the fog
time loop, archer approaches, golem tries to warn/ stop them
