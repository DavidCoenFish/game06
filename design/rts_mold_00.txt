slime mold rts

start with one building and 10 units, 100 food, near some food. units can collect the food and take it to any building. 
each unit gathers about 5 food every 10 seconds.
1000 food at each base location.
four units selected allows you to build another build, consuming the four units
one unit allows you to build an add on that must be attached to a building, consuming the unit
by default, building can create a worker every 10 seconds, costing 50 food. initial health is 25
building has 100 health, addons have 25 health
addon attached to a building modify the units built from that building going forward, not including unfinished units. 
you get a limited number of add ons of each type say 10, not replenished over 3 rounds? but have a lot of differnt addons.
add on may do things like add mellee attack, reduce cost/time, add attack range, add flight, add move speed, add armour, 
root into ground (x2 armor, x2 range?), visiblity range, cliff jump, swim, 
building has six slots for add ons, adjacent addons of the same type can be combined to form ablitites, 2 for passive, 3 for active, with more addons reducing cooldown time
2 adjacent "extra health" gives passive healing, 3 gives castable heal
2 adjacent "melle attack" gives splash?
2 adjacent "armor" gives shields that recover over time
2 adjacent "range" gives splash, 3  gives gerenade? or tentical reach?
2 adjacent "projectile", 3 gives snipe? 
damage over time/ posion
2 adjacent "flight" speed, 3 for ablity to land and take off?
cliff jump -> blink
abilty to transport others?
root to ground -> burrow
visiblity range -> see burrowed/ cloaked
move speed -> boost?
consume food ablity? vampire? faster gather?
stun -> neural
some abblity that ends up allowing garrioned units to leave at other building? or is that default? cliff jump->tepeport
or would telleporting buildings be more fun. you may get quite the cool down

using both ablities (cliff jump, boost) allows teleport?


is there a way to get to neural parrisite? viper grappling shot? damage over time anti air?

all units have default "gather food" slow mellee attach

flying uints can use mellee attacks on other flyers, includeding gather "food"/eat



aim for 20 addons? reserve on key for making builing, and some/two keys for ablitites? 
max of two ablities if it takes 3 addons joinded to make an ablity?

to build a unit, the food cost and time to build increase with nb of addons.

can gather food from dead units? can also gather food from alive units, amount of food is production cost minus health
pathfinding blocked? by dead big units?
increase trave cost over tiles related to population in the tile, either gound, underground or in sky

all units can gather food?
all units can be converted to buildings
building get dimished version of skills of input units. does this allow flying buildings. yes. not very fast and only flying units could drop off food.
addon get dimished version of skill, but is still attached to building

can buildings use ablitites? if all 4 input units had some ablity. do ablities mix into new ablitites, so a builds still gets the 'w','e' ablitites....

units food gather/ damage to things not dead is half speed of gather food otherwise
cancling building losses health that was converted to building. damaged units build/ transform slower


building can eat your own units for food? slow? a flying building could eat a neural controlled flying building, but may not finish before neural, so eating is a form of damage

building is 4x4 with corners knocked off

add on is 2x2

unit mostly fills up one square, but as they get more addons (other than cheaper) they gain size. cheaper addon make things smaller/ cheapers/ weaker?

building - make unit, start to eat garrisoned, spit out garrisoned, ablity a, ablity b (if most of units that built building had compatable ablities)
unit - garrison, ablity a, b, transform to building, transform to attachment [a,b,c,d,.....]

get the audio where your cursor is? buildings sing? (do[c] do[d] do[c]-di[e]-do[d]-do[c])  addons just angry hummm, units make quick (nomnomnomnom) while eating
cliff jump say "boing"?

big units build a bigger building?
(max 7 addons)

is random to get skill of input units on building, but 100% if all four input units have the same skill

can't garrison while making units? and cant make units while garrion? can ungarrison from any building?
or can't garrison if all buildings are building. can queue up into negative, but need the food to be submitted before you can build. can remove units from build queue

trapped in starter tutorial till killing tutorial host... if you ignore the tutorial instructions the host start to take things seriously and tries to win
tutorial host otherwise is just a flying building with neural "yeap, i am a flying building in an rts, bet you have never seen that before"

dead bodies can accumulate to block map, can be gather for food or damaged to remove

implementation
	photoshop style cached tiles of traversal distance maps, invalidate tile on change, and paths using tile
	density map of population/ slowdown of each cell
	visiblity map, what each player can currently see, has seen of the map
	render list units/ buildings and what they are doing.
	frame state database (unit build, unit move, build building, gather resources, special abblities, camera)
		state database can rewind (single player's undo/ and multiplay network message stitch in)
		save to current time, save full database
		- how to order input from multiple players on same frame? mod order for player index?


extern to input is the change id of the frame input- only have what needs to be saved in the input database, but have extra data for each frame like the change id
frame change id array std::vector<{int byte stream offset, int change id}>
input database
	initial config, engine version, game mode, map id, initial nb players? starting pos? bytestream length
	byte stream of [command length, id, data....][command length, ...
	0 frame id [4 bytes]
	1 set selection self, unit id
	2 add selection self, unit id
	3 set selection generic, player count, player id, unit count, units
	2 build drone, unit id
	3 selected unit command gather
	4 selected unit command gather target coord
	5 set building waypoint
	6 select unit move
	6 select unit attack move
