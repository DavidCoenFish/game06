strech goal, make it loop

hooded character approaches cameleon like stone statue, swats a mosquito on there arm, in a dark world with sparce thin trees and strong edge lighting
breifly examins statue, and then pokes it
the character recoils back in shock, starts to turn into stone from where touch happened
cameleon statue turns back into flesh from stone, starts runs, but starts to turn back into stone from touching ground
character turns back to flesh, chases cameleon, but again turns to stone from touching it
camealon tries to flee, but doesn't get far before being turned back to stone
back and forth continues
   character morping into cameleon, cameleon morphing into mosquito
character finially catches the fleeing "cameleon" by cupping hands around the mosquito/ firefly that was the cameleon
character now looks like cameleon, on opening hands, eats the mosquito
looks up to hand shadow falling to squash entire area, 
[time loop] camera pulls out with hand to change reference to character approaching the stone cameleon statue
