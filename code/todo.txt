slightly rounded main menu buttons in middle, middle stack, dull text, buttons with drop shadows
on roll over, burn out the text to black from mouse pos, fade back if cursor leaves. on keyboard selection, a default rollover pos in the middle?
full screen texture detecting full red pixels to simulate fire effect? (red -> fire then smoke, blue -> ice then mist, green to poision then rain)

ui system
	present geometry (), 
		geometry for a given size and offset in a parent container size
		texture from child, if bigger than our size, then a slow auto scroll unless manual control set

	canvas, stack, flow, text, image, padding, <effect, get told rollover?>?, <toggle>?, <interactable, ie, button, has one child for visual, or n children for state>
	are effects a thing in a node, or a unique node?
	where do interactable/ buttons fit in? 
	<effect rollover? pass to shader the relative mouse position and true/false for mouse over>
	<interactable? have a child for each state and only draw when in that state, allow same child in multiple states
		[default, mouse over, mouse down]

	shrink to content is a flag on each node?

	canvas (n children with pos)
	stack ([horizontal, vertical] flag wrap on bounds, n children, flag manuel scroll on overflow)
	switch (n children but only one is visible) <tab, checkbox>
	text
	image
	fill
	padding
	effect (some effects may take mouse pos?)
	interactable (n children for given input state)


a locale system might get queried with a key and give back a DagValueString
a text renderer, on change of selected locale may be a good time to trigger a release of all the rendered glyphs
